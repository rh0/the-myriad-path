= The Box Model Challenge
:hp-tags: css, challenge

At this poing you should be able to create a simple HTML document, link it to external stylesheets, commit your work, and push your work up to GitHub.  If you are unable to do this please review the previous posts.  Hopefully you have taken things a little further than I have laid out here, and spent some time playing with HTML/CSS. If not then get ready, because you are about to!

== The Box Model
Each element in an HTML document is represented by a rectangular box. This box can be provided with a host of properties via CSS.  The most notable (and the ones we will focus on for now) include:

* width / height
* background color / images
* borders
* margins
* padding 

These properties can be visualized in _Figure 1._  The background property is represented by the green color.

It is very helpful to keep this image in mind when working with elements on the page, especially as positioning and alignment become increasingly important.  Something that may not be immediately apparent, is that when we say, _"each element in the HTML document is represented by the box model,"_ this includes elements that contain other elements.  This outer element is often called a *wrapper*, and its *children*, the elements it contains, will appear in the _content area_ shown in _Figure 1._

Often we will use wrappers to help with positioning and grouping of its child elements on the page.  This allows us to have discrete sections.  Think header, footer, sidebar, etc.  Very often this *parent* (wrapper) element will be the `<div>`.

NOTE: Before folks start lighting the torches, I should mention there are many more potential wrappers, especially for big site sections. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#Content_sectioning[HTML5 has specific wrappers for a lot of the site sections you may build out] like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, and even `<section>`.  I'm blatantly ignoring them for now, and only focusing on the more generic `<div>` to try and avoid information overload. Don't worry, HTML5 will be adressed once everyone has their legs, so to speak.
